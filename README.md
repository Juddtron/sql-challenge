Employee-SQL


THE STORY:
It’s been two weeks since I were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

THE PLAN:
For this project, I’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. 

Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Data Analysis
List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

Output:

Data Modeling

Entity Relationship Diagram is included or table schemas provided for all tables 

Data Engineering 

All required columns are defined for each table 
Columns are set to the correct data type 
Primary Keys set for each table 
Correctly references related tables 
Tables are correctly related using Foreign Keys 
Correctly uses NOT NULL condition on necessary columns 
Accurately defines value length for columns 

Data Analysis

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
